/* ══ playful blocks ═══════════════════════════════════════
   Two components whose behaviour is the joke. The material
   stays as quiet as everything else on this bench — no
   confetti, no exclamation marks, no sound. If the decoration
   is doing the work then the interaction is not.

   THE JOKE HAS TO RESOLVE. A button that never lets itself be
   clicked is friction with a smirk on it. A button that
   dodges four times and then gives up is a small story with
   an ending, and the ending is the reason it is worth
   shipping rather than a garnish on top of one.

   Which makes one rule absolute here: none of these may trap
   anybody. Every one of them completes, every one of them
   completes within a few seconds, and every one of them
   completes from the keyboard on the first try — the tease is
   a pointer phenomenon and a person who is not using a
   pointer is not the audience for it. */

/* ══ 3 · Slosh ════════════════════════════════════════════
   A slider whose value has mass.

   The handle is rigid — it is under your finger and anything
   under a finger that lags it is broken. The FILL is a second
   spring behind it, softer and barely damped, so a fast drag
   throws it past the handle, into the end stop, and rocks it
   back two or three times before it settles. Release halfway
   and the handle coasts on the velocity it actually had
   rather than stopping dead where you let go.

   The tilt is what sells it as liquid. A bar that lags is a
   laggy bar; a bar whose leading edge leans in the direction
   it is travelling is a surface with a meniscus on it. Same
   lag, entirely different object.

   Nothing here goes through React. The loop writes width, a
   custom property and one text node straight onto three
   elements, and it stops the moment everything is at rest —
   there is one permanent rAF on this bench already and
   CLAUDE.md is not complimentary about it. */
